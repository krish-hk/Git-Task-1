1. forked using fork option and cloned using git clone https://github.com/krish-hk/Git-Task-1.git
2. Tried creating the file using the terminal but when pushing, got the error:

remote: Support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021.
remote: Please see https://docs.github.com/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories#cloning-with-https-urls for information on currently recommended modes of authentication.
fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/krish-hk/Git-Task-1.git/'

so I downloaded the Desktop app and made it using vs code.

3. created brach using desktop app
4. made markdown file using .md as suffix after file_name
5. git log -1 --format=%H - here log gets the history and -1 limits it to j the previous commit. and %H gives the commit hash
6. merged in the app

(Learned basics of Git from https://learngitbranching.js.org/ but bcoz of the problem in pushing, I used the Desktop app)
